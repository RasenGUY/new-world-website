						<h3>Teaching</h3>
						<p>Teaching in New World is pretty straight forward. The volunteers of New World are tasked with helping vietnamese students with pronunciation and and getting acquainted expressing themselves through the use of the english language. Grammar itself is taught by vietnamese english teachers (some also hired by New World). While it is not your job to teach grammar, you are still allowed to incorporate that in your classes (depending of course which type of classes). Vietnamese teachers and volunteers teach english at the different new world centers across Thai Binh. Next to teaching at the New World centers themselves, the volunteers of New World are also hired by many state schools and private schools in Thai Binh to teach english to kids. So as a volunteer you may find yourself sometimes teaching at the New World center (s) or other times at different schools in different parts of Thai Binh.<p> <!-- go around the house take pictures of the rooms in the weeked -->

						<div class="img-gallery pull-left" style="background: grey; margin-right: 2rem;"></div>

						<h3>Important to know</h3>
						<p class="text-justify">There are 4 New World centers spread across Thai Bin. Mis hong is the director of the New World International English center which includes all of New World centers in Thai Binh. Mis Hong, her husband and two sons live a short distance away from Kien Xuong. Mis Hong is the go to person for any questions regarding your stay in Thai Binh, anything regarding your visa, your accommodation and also food. Mis Hong is also the one who is in charge of the teaching schedule. More information on the main center can be found on the about page<p>
	
						<p class="text-justify">First there is the main center, at the main center in Thai binh there are teaching aids (staff) which are also coordinators e.g. Mis Ly, Mis Liene, Mis Quey and Mis Huong. Mis Ly is like the right hand man of Mis Hong, she helps around with a multitude of tasks ranging from helping around in the center, assisting the volunteers with teaching and she also overseas some of the planning of classes that go on. In your stay you will also encounter Mis Lyâ€™s Husband, Duc he is also the all around helper in the center he does not teach though he just helps with the maintenance of the center. Mis Liene is  charged with creating the lesson planning for secondary schools. Mis Huong is charged with creating the lesson plans for primary schools and she does this with the help of Mis Mai who works at the New World English center in Diem Dien. Just like the other teaching staff, mis huong helps helps as the vietnamese teaching assistant in some classes taught by volunteers. Finally, Mis Quey is charged with the lesson plans of kindergarten school. Furthermore she is also a vietnamese teaching assistant. It is important to note that almost all of the staff mentioned, teach English grammar to students, the volunteers job is to help with vocabulary, pronunciation and more importantly help vietnamese students to become acquainted to interacting through the english language.<p>
						<p class="text-justify">First of all, Coordinator/manager of the second center is Mis  Mai. Mis mai lives in Vu Thu at the location of the second New World center. She has two daughters Minh Thu and Thang Thu. Mis Mai is very hospitable and generous, she will guide you through your classes if you have to teach in Vu Thu.

					<div class="accommodation text-justify">
						<div class="img-gallery pull-right" style="background: grey; margin-left: 2rem;"></div>
						<h3>Accomodation</h3>
						<p>In Thai Binh , we have 2 houses. Old House (old centre) has 8 bedrooms, spread across 3 floors. There is a Bathroom on every floor with showering facilities.The switch on the outside of each bathroom heats the water in advance. Within 30 mins you will have enough Hot water .The bedrooms are quite generous in size. A wardrobe, bed(pillows & duvet) and a desk live in the room. Each Bedroom has a full functioning balcony for relaxing,chillaxing or spruce up with some colors and flowers.Totally up to you. In the main house classes can be held during the day,in the evenings and on weekends. So there are 2 classrooms conjoining off the kitchen downstairs. Fully equipped with everything needed (ie. Tables,chairs,projector and audio leads.) In the second classroom the entrance to the back garden is located. It's quite a spacious area & enclosed . It's nice to bring your kindergartners for a bit of a refresh between classes. There are also 2 classrooms on the 4th Floor upstairs. Again fully equipped with everything necessary. The lobby area downstairs is quite big with our dining table, the reception & a seating area for the kids and parents when needed.</p>
						<p>The second house is also the main building of the New World International center. Most of you will be staying in this building (if there is space left). You will also be giving teaching some of your english classes in this building. The building is a story building that houses 6 classrooms, one large kitchen, a balcony on the 5th and 6th floor, one public bathroom on each of the floors except for the 5th and the 6th - On these floor there is one bathroom in the double rooms-, four double rooms - these are shared rooms in which two people can stay-, 4 single bedrooms and one common room on the 4th floor. All of the single rooms are equipped with a king size bed a desk and a wardrobe. All of the bedroom have two of each (wardrobe, desk and kingsize bed). Two of the 4 single rooms are spacious rooms and the other two are fairly sized but. There is also airconditioning in all of the rooms, but some rooms share on 1 airco (4 rooms in total). There is also a common laundry room, the laundry rooms has a washing machine but no dryer. So all of the clothes are air/sundried on the 6th floor on racks.</p>
						<div class="img-gallery pull-left" style="background: grey; margin-right: 2rem;"></div>

						<h3 class="text-left">Food</h3>
						<p>New World provides food for its volunteers twice a day everyday. Lunch is served around 11:00 am day everyday. And dinner around 6:30pm everyday. The menu is always vietnamese dishes, but if you would like you can also cook some food yourself as some volunteers also do. Meat is generally served, but if your a vegetarian, food will be prepared for you as well just let us know beforehand so that the cook takes you into consideration. Food is for the most part eaten together, in the main house (the main center) we eat together and we also clean up together. Sometimes volunteers chose to eat out or eat with the families of their students, this is completely fine, but it is very much appreciated if the volunteer lets the staff know that they are not going to partake in the meals as to reduce the wastage of food.</p>
